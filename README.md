# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System (OOP in Kotlin)

A console-based **Movie Recommendation System** implemented in **Kotlin** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.  
Users can view movies, rate them, get recommendations, and track their watched movies.

---

## **Features**

1. **View All Movies** â€“ Lists all movies in the library with type and year.  
2. **Rate a Movie** â€“ Allows the user to rate any movie (1â€“5 stars). Updates user genre preferences dynamically.  
3. **Get Recommendations** â€“ Displays top recommended movies for the user based on ratings and preferences.  
4. **Add a New Movie** â€“ Add new Action, Drama, or Comedy movies dynamically.  
5. **View Watched Movies & Ratings** â€“ Shows all movies rated by the user.  
6. **Exit** â€“ Exit the program gracefully.  

---

## **OOP Principles Used**

- **Encapsulation** â€“ User preferences, ratings, and watched movies are managed inside the `User` class.  
- **Inheritance** â€“ `Action`, `Drama`, `Comedy` inherit from the base `Movie` class.  
- **Polymorphism** â€“ `getRecommendationScore(user: User)` is overridden in subclasses for different scoring logic.  
- **Abstraction** â€“ Abstract class `RecommendationActions` defines actions for rating and recommending movies.

If you want, I can also **create a shorter, GitHub-ready version with badges and emoji icons** to make it look more aesthetic for your repository.  

Do you want me to do that?
